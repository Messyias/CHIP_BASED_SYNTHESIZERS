SID Synth
================
One MOS 8580 SID chip and one Teensy 2.0

Thanks for your interest in my SID Synth.  Here's a video that covers all of the features I included on the synthesizer.

The directory above contains a schematic diagram, a feature list/cc&channel guide pdf, and the .ino file which contains the code, as well as a parts list and some wiring instructions to supplement the schematic.

It should be possible (although I haven't tried it) to use a MOS 6581 SID chip in place of the 8580.  All that you would need to change is replacing the 9 volt power supply with 12 volts.

Below are two videos showing 5 of these synthesizers making music.
