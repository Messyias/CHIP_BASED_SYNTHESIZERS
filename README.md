CHIP_BASED_SYNTHESIZERS
=======================

A Collection Of Chip-Based Synthesizers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your interest in my Arduino-based chip synthesizers.  I made a video for each one that covers the features and sounds, and I also made two videos of all the synths being used to make music together.

Here's the two song videos:

You can find the feature overview videos of each synth in the readme files of their respective directories.  Each directory contains a feature list, channel/cc guide, schematic diagram, instructions, parts list, and the required code to get you up and running.
